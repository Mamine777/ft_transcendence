How it works :
is just you put export before a function, 
so you do a function that takes the server as parameter,
Then put all the routes inside so the function handles all the routes and then
You can export it as a module, but this can be done only if we use this compilator : npx ts-node cuz this takes nodes even if we don't have them in the config.
